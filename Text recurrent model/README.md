<b>Introduction</b>


Recurrent neural networks are very useful when it comes to the processing of sequential data like text. In this tutorial, we are going to use LSTM neural networks (Long-Short-Term Memory) in order to tech our computer to write texts like Shakespeare.
We are going to train a neural network to write texts similar to those of the famous poet. At least kind of. Since recurrent neural networks and LSTMs in particular have a short term memory, we can train it to “guess” the next letter based on the letters that came before. That leads to our network producing these texts. For this of course we will need some substantial training data.
